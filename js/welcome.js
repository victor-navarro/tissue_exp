	<p>We invite you to participate in a research study.  The purpose of the study is to see how people learn categories. Approximately 200 participants will take part in this study.</p>\
	<p>If you agree to participate, we would like you to complete a task on the computer. During the task, you will be presented with different pictures. You will have to categorize each image by pressing keys in your keyboard. You need to learn to categorize them correctly. At the beginning, you will not know, but you will be provided visual feedback (the words CORRECT or ERROR); this feedback will guide you in the learning process. Once the computer task finishes, you will be asked a few simple questions and be given a debriefing summary.</p>\
	<p>We will keep the information you provide confidential, however federal regulatory agencies and the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board (a committee that reviews and approves research studies) may inspect and copy records pertaining to this research. To help protect your confidentiality, we will be using a random identifier (e.g., "3c") to identify your computer responses. All records will be maintained in locked offices or in password protected files on a secure computer system.  If we write a report about this study, we will do so in such a way that you cannot be identified.</p>\
	<p>The risk of participating in this study is minimal, no more than what you may experience interacting with a computer in your daily life. </p>\
	<p>You will receive a total of ' + welcome.task.pay + ' for your participation in our study. Upon completion of the study, you will receive a code, and you will have to input that code in the Amazon Mechanical Turk page to receive your payment. Additionally, you will receive a bonus payment of '+ welcome.task.bonus + ' if you make more correct responses than the average of all participants in this study. If you qualify for this bonus, you will receive it after we finish collecting our data. There are no additional personal benefits from being in this study. However we hope that others may benefit in the future from what we learn as a result of this study.</p>\
	<p>If you agree to take part in this study, your involvement will last for approximately 30 min. If you decide not to be in this study, or if you want to stop participating at any time, you can just close this browser window. You will not be penalized for this.</p>\
	<p>If you have any questions about the research study itself or have issues with your payment, please contact Victor Navarro (<a href="mailto:victor-navarro@uiowa.edu">victor-navarro@uiowa.edu</a>).
